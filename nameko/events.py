"""
Provides a high level interface to the core messaging module.

Events are special messages, which can be emitted by one service
and handled by other listening services.

An event consists of an identifier and some data and is dispatched using an
injection acquired from an instance of :class:`EventDispatcher`.

Events are dispatched asynchronously. It is only guaranteed that the event has
been dispatched, not that it was received or handled by a listener.

To listen to an event, a service must declare a handler using the
:func:`handle_event` entrypoint, providing the target service and an event type
filter.

Example::

    # service A
    def edit_foo(self, id):
        # ...
        self.dispatch('foo_updated', {'id': id})

    # service B

    @handle_event('service_a', 'foo_updated')
    def bar(event_data):
        pass

class EventDispatcher(Publisher):
    """ Provides an event dispatcher method via dependency injection.

    Events emitted will be dispatched via the service's events exchange,
    which automatically gets declared by the event dispatcher
    as a topic exchange.
    The name for the exchange will be `{service-name}.events`.

    Events, emitted via the dispatcher, will be serialized and published
    to the events exchange. The event's type attribute is used as the
    routing key, which can be used for filtering on the listener's side.

    The dispatcher will return as soon as the event message has been published.
    There is no guarantee that any service will receive the event, only
    that the event has been successfully dispatched.

        The `broadcast_identifier` is appended to the queue name when the
        `BROADCAST` handler type is used. It must uniquely identify service
        instances that receive broadcasts.

        The default `broadcast_identifier` is a uuid that is set when the
        service starts. It will change when the service restarts, meaning
        that any unconsumed messages that were broadcast to the 'old' service

        The default behaviour is therefore incompatible with reliable delivery.

        restarts is ::

            def broadcast_identifier(self):
                # use the machine hostname as the identifier.
