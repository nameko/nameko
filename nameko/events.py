"""
Provides a high level interface to the core messaging module.

Events are special messages, which can be emitted by one service
and handled by other listening services.

To emit an event, a service must define an :class:`Event` class with a unique
type and dispatch an instance of it using an injection acquired from an
instance of :class:`EventDispatcher`.

Events are dispatched asynchronously. It is only guaranteed that the event has
been dispatched, not that it was received or handled by a listener.

To listen to an event, a service must declare a handler using the
:func:`handle_event` entrypoint, providing the target service and an event type
filter.

Example::

    class MyEvent(Event):
        type = "myevent"

    @handle_event("foo_service", "myevent")
    def bar(evt):
        pass

    Events, emitted via the dispatcher, will be serialized and published

    ``handler_type`` determines the behaviour of the handler:

        - ``events.SERVICE_POOL``:

            Event handlers will be pooled by service type and handler-method
            and one from each pool will receive the event. ::

        - ``events.SINGLETON``:

            Events will be received by only one registered handler.
            If requeued on error, they may be given to a different
            handler. ::

                                       (service Y handler-method)

        - ``events.BROADCAST``:
            Events will be received by every handler. This  will broadcast
            to every service instance, not just every service type

                            [queue]- (service Y handler-method)

    If ``requeue_on_error``, handlers will return the event to the queue if an
    error occurs while handling it. Defaults to ``False``.

    If ``reliable_delivery``, events will be kept in the queue until there is
    a handler to consume them. Defaults to ``False``.

    ``event_handler_cls`` may be specified to use a different EventHandler
        (sub)class for custom behaviour.

    is set to ``BROADCAST`` and ``reliable_delivery`` is set to ``True``.
