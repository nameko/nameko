    '''
    Provides a message publisher method via dependency injection.

    Publishers usually publish messages to an exchange which dispatches
    messages to bound queue.
    To simplify this various use cases a Publisher either accepts
    a bound queue or an exchange and will ensure both are declared before
    a message is published.

    Example::

        class Foobar(object):

            publish = Publisher(exchange=...)

            def spam(self, data):
                self.publish('spam:' + data)

def consume(queue, fn=None):
    '''
    Decorates a method as a message consumer.

    Messaages from the queue will be deserialized depending on their content
    type and passed to the the decorated method.
    When the conumer method returns without raising any exceptions, the message
    will automatically be acknowledged.
    If any exceptions are raised during the consumtion, the message will be
    requeued.

    It is possible to manually acknowledge a message from within the consumer.
    To achieve this, it needs to accept a second parameter, the raw message
    object and call ack() or requeue() on it.

    Example::

        @consume(...)
        def handle_message(self, body, message):
