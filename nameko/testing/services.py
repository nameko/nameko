def worker_factory(service_cls, **dependencies):
    """ Return an instance of ``service_cls`` with its injected dependencies
    replaced with :class:`~mock.MagicMock` objects, or as given in
    ``dependencies``.

    **Usage**

    The following example service proxies calls to a "maths" service via
    an ``RpcProxy`` dependency::

        from nameko.rpc import RpcProxy, rpc

        class ConversionService(object):
            name = "conversions"

            maths_rpc = RpcProxy("maths")

            @rpc
            def inches_to_cm(self, inches):
                return self.maths_rpc.multiply(inches, 2.54)

            @rpc
            def cm_to_inches(self, cms):
                return self.maths_rpc.divide(cms, 2.54)

    Use the ``worker_factory`` to create an instance of
    ``ConversionService`` with its dependencies replaced by MagicMock objects::

        service = worker_factory(ConversionService)

    Nameko's entrypoints do not modify the service methods, so instance methods
    can be called directly with the same signature. The replaced dependencies
    can be used as any other MagicMock object, so a complete unit test for
    the conversion service may look like this::

        # create worker instance
        service = worker_factory(ConversionService)

        # replace "maths" service
        service.maths_rpc.multiply.side_effect = lambda x, y: x * y
        service.maths_rpc.divide.side_effect = lambda x, y: x / y

        # test inches_to_cm business logic
        assert service.inches_to_cm(300) == 762
        service.maths_rpc.multiply.assert_called_once_with(300, 2.54)

        # test cms_to_inches business logic
        assert service.cms_to_inches(762) == 300
        service.maths_rpc.divide.assert_called_once_with(762, 2.54)

    *Providing Dependencies*

    The ``**dependencies`` kwargs to ``worker_factory`` can be used to provide
    a replacement dependency instead of a mock. For example, to unit test a
    service against a real database:

    .. literalinclude::
        ../examples/testing/alternative_dependency_unit_test.py

    If a named dependency provider does not exist on ``service_cls``, a
    ``ExtensionNotFound`` exception is raised.
