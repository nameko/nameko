Version 2.9.0
-------------

Released: 2018-05-30

* RPC reply queues are now set to expire rather than auto-delete, and
  are no longer exclusive, allowing clients reconnect. Fixes #359.
* It's now possible to accept messages in multiple serialization formats.
  Adds config-based mechanism for specifying custom serializers. See #535.
* Enhanced environment variable substitution including recursive references.
  See #515.

Version 2.8.5
-------------

Released: 2018-03-15

* Workaround for a Kombu bug causing new sockets to sometimes have short
  timeouts. (#521)

  replicate the previous behaviour.

Version 2.8.3
-------------

Released: 2018-01-12

* Restrict eventlet to `<0.22.0` until we're compatible.

Version 2.8.2
-------------

Released: 2017-12-11

* Remove the pytest `--log-level` argument added by the pytest plugin since
  this conflicts with newer versions of `pytest` (`>= 3.3.0`). For older
  versions this can be restored by installing the `pytest-catchlog` package.


Version 2.8.1
-------------

Released: 2017-11-29

* Added the 'show-config' command which will print the service configuration
  to the console, after environment variable substitution.


Version 2.8.0
-------------

Released: 2017-10-31

* Environment variables substituted into config files are now interpreted
  as YAML rather than bare values, allowing use of rich data types.


Version 2.7.0
-------------

Released: 2017-10-07

* Set stopped flag in register_provider() to allow PollingQueueConsumer
  object reuse [fixes #462]
* Refactor of AMQP message publishing logic into `nameko.amqp.publish`
* Exposes delivery options and other messaging configuration to AMQP-based
  DependencyProviders. [addresses #374]
* Class attributes for configuring `use_confirms`, `retry` and `retry_policy`
  have been deprecated from the Publisher, EventDispatcher, and RPC MethodProxy
  classes. If you were subclassing these classes to set these options, you
  should now set them at class instantiation time.


Version 2.6.0
-------------

Released: 2017-04-30

* Environment variables are now interpreted as native YAML data types rather
  than just strings
* The WSGI Server now uses an explicit logger so it can be controlled using a
  logging config
* Drops several backwards-compatibility shims that were marked as being
  maintained only until this release


Version 2.5.4
-------------

Released: 2017-04-20

* Don't block the QueueConsumer thread on the worker pool, which could cause
  service deadlock and occasional dropped AMQP connections [fixes #428]
* Revert prefetch count change from 2.5.3 and ack messages outside of the
  QueueConsumer thread. [fixes #417 more robustly]


Version 2.5.3
-------------

Released: 2017-03-16

* Bump the amqp `prefetch_count` by 1 to `max_workers + 1` to fix throughput
  issue. [fixes 417]


Version 2.5.2
-------------

Released 2017-02-28

* Improves teardown speed of the `rabbit_config` pytest fixture
* Support for providing an alternative reply listener to the standalone
  RPC proxy

Version 2.5.1
-------------

Released 2017-01-19

* Adds a DependencyProvider to give services access to the config object
* Internal refactor to make all worker lifecycle steps run in the same thread

Version 2.5.0
-------------

Released 2016-12-20

* Enables publish confirms by default for all AMQP message publishers
* Refactors common AMQP connection code into `nameko.amqp`

Version 2.4.4
-------------

Released 2016-11-28

* Adds AMQP heartbeats to Consumer connections
* Handles an uncaught exception caused by a fast-disconnecting client under
  Python 3 [fixes #367]

Version 2.4.3
-------------

Released 2016-11-16

* Pins kombu back to a compatible release (<4) [fixes #378]
* Fixes compatibility with latest bpython and ipython shells
  [fixes #355 and #375]
* Fixes socket cleanup bug in websocket hub [fixes #367]

Version 2.4.2
-------------

Released 2016-10-10

* Added support for environment variables in YAML config files
* Enhanced :func:`~nameko.testing.services.entrypoint_waiter`. The new
  implementation is backwards compatible but additionally:

    - Gives you access to the result returned (or exception raised)
    - Adds the ability to wait for a specific result
    - Doesn't fire until the worker is completely torn down

Version 2.4.1
-------------

Released 2016-09-14

* Enhanced :class: `~nameko.web.server.WebServer` with `get_wsgi_app` and
  `get_wsgi_server` to allow easy usage of WSGI middleware and modifications
  of the WSGI server.
* Enhanced :func:`~nameko.testing.services.replace_dependencies` to allow
  specific replacement values to be provided with named arguments.

Version 2.4.0
-------------

Released 2016-08-30

* Add dictionary access to ``standalone.rpc.ClusterProxy`` to allow the proxy
  to call services whose name is not a legal identifier in python
  (e.g. name has a ``-`` in it).
* Add the ability to specify a custom `ServiceContainer` class via config key.
  Deprecate the keyword arguments to `ServiceRunner` and `run_services` for
  the same purpose.
* Deprecate the keyword arguments to `run_services`, `ServiceContainer` and
  `ServiceRunner.add_service` for specifying a custom `WorkerContext` class.
  Custom `WorkerContext` classes can now only be specified with a custom
  `ServiceContainer` class that defines the `worker_ctx_cls` attribute.
* Remove the `context_keys` attribute of the `WorkerContext`, which was
  previously used to "whitelist" worker context data passed from call to call.
  It was a feature that leaked from a specific implementation into the main
  framework, and not useful enough in its own right to continue to be
  supported.
* Refactor `ServiceContainer` internals for better separation between "managed"
  and "worker" threads. Improved logging when threads are killed.

Version 2.3.1
-------------

Released 2016-05-11

* Deprecate ``MethodProxy.async`` in favour of ``MethodProxy.call_async`` in
  preparation for async becoming a keyword
* Add support for loading logging configuration from ``config.yaml``


Version 2.3.0
-------------

Released 2016-04-05

* Add support for loading configuration file in ``nameko shell`` via
  ``--config`` option
* Changed :class:`~nameko.web.handlers.HttpRequestHandler` to allow override
  how web exceptions are handled
* Enabled reliable delivery on broadcast events when combined with a custom
  :py:attr:`~nameko.events.EventHandler.broadcast_identity`. Reliable delivery
  now defaults to enabled for all handler types. It must be explicitly turned
  off with broadcast mode unless you override the default `broadcast_identity`.
* Update bundled pytest fixtures to use a random vhost in RabbitMQ by default
* Now requires eventlet>=0.16.1 because older versions were removed from PyPI

Version 2.2.0
-------------

Released 2015-10-04

* Add support for alternative serializers in AMQP messages
* Add pytest plugin with common fixtures
* Fix examples in documentation and add tests to prevent future breakage
* Fix bug handling non-ascii characters in exception messages
* Various documentation fixes

Version 2.1.0
-------------

Released 2015-04-13

* Changed default AMQP URI so examples work with an unconfigured RabbitMQ.
* Heuristic messages for AMQP connection errors.
* Added six to requirements.

  `nameko-nova-compat <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nameko-nova-compat>`_
* Rename the standalone rpc proxy to
  :class:`~nameko.standalone.rpc.ServiceRpcProxy` and add a
  :class:`~nameko.standalone.rpc.ClusterRpcProxy`, using a single reply queue
  for communicating with multiple remote services.
* Make the standalone event dispatcher more shell-friendly, connecting on
  demand.


Version 1.14.0
--------------

Released 2014-12-19

* Remove parallel provider in favour of async RPC
* Update :func:`~nameko.testing.services.worker_factory` to raise if asked to
  replace a non-existent injection.
* Add various ``__repr__`` methods for better logging
* Support for timeouts in the (non-legacy) standalone RPC proxy

Version 1.13.0
--------------

Released 2014-12-02

* RPC reply queues now auto-delete.
* Extra protection against badly-behaved dependencies during container kill
* Make legacy :class:`~nameko.legacy.nova.NovaRpcConsumer` more robust against
  failures in the :class:`~nameko.legacy.nova.NovaRpc` provider.


Version 1.12.0
--------------

Released 2014-11-25

* Add ability to make asynchronous rpc calls using the rpc proxy.
* Add a new nameko context key ``user_agent`` to support including such info
  in the rpc header.


Version 1.11.5
--------------

Released 2014-11-18

* Have the standalone rpc proxy mark its reply queues as auto-delete, to stop
  them staying around after use.


Version 1.11.4
--------------

Released 2014-11-10

* Make :class:`~nameko.rpc.RpcConsumer` more robust against failures in the
  :class:`~nameko.rpc.Rpc` provider.
* Add a new exception :class:`~nameko.exceptions.MalformedRequest` that RPC
  providers can raise if they detect an invalid message. Raise this exception
  in the default ``Rpc`` provider if ``args`` or ``kwargs`` keys are missing
  from the message.
* Fix issues in queue consumer tests against non-localhost brokers.
* Upgrade to eventlet 0.15.2.
* Include pyrabbit in ``requirements.txt`` (no longer just for tests).
* Catch dying containers in the entrypoint_hook to avoid hangs.
* Add ``expected_exceptions`` kwarg to the rpc entrypoint to enable different
  exception handling (in dependencies) for user vs system errors.


Version 1.11.3
--------------

Released 2014-10-10

* Add more logging for workers killed by
  :meth:`~nameko.containers.ServiceContainer.kill`.


Version 1.11.2
--------------

Released 2014-09-18

* Add a default implementation for ``acquire_injection`` (returning ``None``)
  for dependency providers that are used for side-effects rather than injecting
  dependencies.


Version 1.11.1
--------------

Released 2014-09-15

* New test helper :func:`~nameko.testing.services.entrypoint_waiter` to wait
  for entrypoints (e.g. event handlers) to complete.


Version 1.11.0
--------------

Released 2014-09-01

* Raise a specific ``RpcTimeout`` error in the RPC proxy rather than
  ``socket.timeout`` to avoid confusing kombu's ``Connection.ensure``
* Improve logging helpers
* Use ``inspect.getcallargs`` instead of shadow lambda for RPC argument
  checking
* Add default retry policies to all publishers
* Stricter handling of connections between tests
* Workarounds for RabbitMQ bugs described at
  https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rabbitmq-users/lrl0tYd1L38/discussion

Version 1.10.1
--------------

Released 2014-08-27

* Inspect the service class (instead of an instance) in
  :func:`~nameko.testing.services.worker_factory`. Works better with
  descriptors.
* Explicitly delete ``exc_info`` variable when not needed, to help the
  garbage collector.


Version 1.10.0
--------------

Released 2014-08-14

* Entrypoint providers' handle_result is now able to manipulate and modify and
  return the ``(result, exc_info)`` tuple. This enables default post-processing
  (e.g. serialization, translations)
* Added serialization safety to legacy RPC entrypoint.


Version 1.9.1
-------------

Released 2014-08-12

* Bugfix to exception handling in ``nameko.legacy.dependencies``


Version 1.9.0
-------------

Released 2014-07-15

* No longer relying on eventlet for standalone RPC proxy timeouts.
* Introduced RPC entrypoints compatible with the 'legacy' proxy.


Version 1.8.2
-------------

Released 2014-07-07

* Documentation generator accepts a function listing event classes and adds
  to output accordingly.


Version 1.8.1
-------------

Released 2014-06-23

* Adding ``wait_for_worker_idle`` test helper.

Version 1.8.0
-------------

Released 2014-06-13

* Now passing ``exc_info`` tuples instead of bare exceptions to
  ``worker_result`` and ``handle_result``, to enable exception processing in
  non-worker greenthreads.

Version 1.7.2
-------------

Released 2014-06-10

* :meth:`~nameko.containers.ServiceContainer._run_worker` now calls any
  ``handle_result`` method before dependency teardown.
* Serialization errors now generate a specific error message rather
  than bubbling into the container.
* Minor change to ``nameko_doc`` output.

Version 1.7.1
-------------

Released 2014-05-20

* Added ``language``, ``auth_token`` and ``user_id`` dependency providers to
  make context data available to service workers.
* Refactored constants into their own module.
* Minor test changes to enable testing on shared rabbit brokers.

Version 1.7.0
-------------

Released 2014-05-07

* :meth:`~nameko.containers.ServiceContainer.spawn_worker` now throws
  :class:`~nameko.exceptions.ContainerBeingKilled` if a ``kill`` is
  in progress, since some providers may already be dead. Providers should catch
  this and e.g. requeue rpc messages. There is a race condition between
  completing the kill sequence and remaining entrypoints firing.


Version 1.6.1
-------------

Released 2014-04-03

* Revert changes to legacy exception serialization to maintain backwards
  compatibility with old clients.
* Add forwards compatibility for future clients that wish to serialize
  exceptions into more data
* Promote conftest rabbit manipulations to test helpers


Version 1.6.0
-------------

Released 2014-03-31

* Rename instance_factory to worker_factory
* Raise :class:`~nameko.exception.IncorrectSignature` instead of
  ``RemoteError: TypeError`` if an RPC method is called with invalid arguments.
* Raise :class:`~nameko.exception.MethodNotFound` instead of
  ``RemoteError: MethodNotFound`` if a non-existent RPC method is called.
* Let log handlers format warning messages so that aggregators group them
  correctly.
* Expose the entire dependency provider (rather than just the method name) to
  the worker context.


Version 1.5.0
-------------

Released 2014-03-27

* Improvements to :class:`~nameko.containers.ServiceContainer.kill()` enabling
  better tracebacks and cleaner teardown:

    - Using ``sys.exc_info`` to preserve tracebacks
    - No longer passing exception into
      :meth:`~nameko.extensions.DependencyProvider.kill()`, removing race
      conditions.
    - No longer requiring ``exc`` in
      :class:`~nameko.containers.ServiceContainer.kill()`

Version 1.4.1
-------------

Released 2014-03-26

* Adds the ``nameko_doc`` package, for easing the creation of service-oriented
  documentation.


Version 1.4.0
-------------

Released 2014-03-20

* RPC calls to non-existent services (no queues bound to the RPC exchange with
  the appropriate routing key) now raise an exception instead of hanging
  indefinitely. Note that calls to existing but non-running services (where the
  queue exists but has no consumer) behave as before.


Version 1.3.5
-------------

Released 2014-03-05

* Increased test resilience. Force-closing existing connections on rabbit
  reset


Version 1.3.4
-------------

Released 2014-03-05

-------------

Released 2014-02-13

* Dropping headers with a ``None`` value because they can't be serialized by
  AMQP


Version 1.3.1
-------------

Released 2014-01-28

* Add ``event_handler_cls`` kwarg to the ``event_handler`` entrypoint, for
  using a custom subclass of the ``EventHandler`` provider


Version 1.3.0
-------------

Released 2014-01-23

* Standalone RPC proxy interface changed to class with contextmanager interface
  and manual ``start()`` and ``stop()`` methods.
